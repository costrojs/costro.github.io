Playgrounds allow you to run Costro in your browser, without installing anything!

They are useful for:

- Testing Costro
- Report bugs

```mdx-code-block
import {PlaygroundCardsRow} from '@site/src/components/Playground';

<PlaygroundCardsRow />
```

:::tip
Throughout the documentation you will find code playground links to test each feature independently.
